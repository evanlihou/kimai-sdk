# kimai-sdk
A *partially implemented* way to communicate with Kimai in JavaScript


This project is just intended to be used to share code between the several of my projects which interface with Kimai. It doesn't have methods for every method in the API and processes the data from the server before returning it in ways you might not want in your implementation.
